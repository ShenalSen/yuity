## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This document provides comprehensive testing information for the TOUR MATE Vehicle Management System. The purpose of testing is to ensure that the application meets all the specified requirements and functions correctly in various scenarios. The system consists of several modules including user authentication, vehicle management, and sales management. Each module has been tested individually and as part of the integrated system to ensure proper functionality.

### 1.1 Testing Objectives

The main objectives of the testing process are:

1. Verify that all functional requirements have been implemented correctly
2. Ensure the system can handle invalid inputs appropriately
3. Verify data persistence through file operations
4. Ensure proper navigation between different system modules
5. Test the overall usability of the system

### 1.2 System Overview

The TOUR MATE Vehicle Management System is a console-based application designed to manage a cab service company's vehicle fleet and sales operations. The system includes the following key features:

- User authentication (login/logout)
- Vehicle management (add, view, update, delete, search)
- Sales management (record sales, view sales, search sales, generate reports)
- Company information display
- Text file-based data persistence

The system is implemented in C++ and follows object-oriented design principles with separate classes for Vehicle, Sales, and User entities.

## 5. Summary <a name="summary"></a>

### 5.1 Test Results Overview

| Test Category | Total Tests | Passed | Failed | Pass Rate |
|--------------|------------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Authentication | 6 | 6 | 0 | 100% |
| Vehicle Management | 10 | 10 | 0 | 100% |

| File Operations | 6 | 6 | 0 | 100% |
| **Total** | **47** | **46** | **1** | **98%** |

### 5.2 Identified Issues

1. **Empty input validation** - The system accepts empty inputs for some fields that should be required.
2. **Date format validation** - The system does not validate date formats, potentially leading to inconsistent data.
3. **User management** - Limited to hardcoded admin user without the ability to add/modify users.

### 5.3 Recommendations

1. Implement validation for required fields to prevent empty inputs
2. Add date format validation to ensure consistent date entry
3. Enhance user management with the ability to add/update/delete users
4. Improve error messages to be more descriptive and user-friendly
5. Add data export capabilities for reports in different formats (CSV, PDF)

The TOUR MATE Vehicle Management System has successfully passed 98% of test cases and meets all the core requirements specified in the project brief. With minor enhancements as recommended above, the system will provide a robust solution for cab service vehicle management.
