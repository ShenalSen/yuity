# Further Information 

## Who can answer questions about my assessment?

Questions about the assessment should be directed to the staff member
who has set the task/assessment brief. This will usually be the Module
Leader. They will be happy to answer any queries you have.

Staff members can often provide feedback on an assignment plan but
cannot review any drafts of your work prior to submission. The only
exception to this rule is for Dissertation Supervisors to provide
feedback on a draft of your dissertation.

## Referencing and independent learning

Please ensure you reference a range of credible sources, with due
attention to the academic literature in the area. The time spent on
research and reading from good quality sources will be reflected in the
quality of your submitted work.

Remember that what you get out of university depends on what you put in.
Your teaching sessions typically represent between 10% and 30% of the
time you are expected to study for your degree. A 20-credit module
represents 200 hours of study time. The rest of your time should be
taken up by self-directed study.

Unless stated otherwise you must use the **HARVARD** referencing system.
Further guidance on referencing can be found in the Study Smart area on
Moodle and at
[www.citethemrightonline.com](http://www.citethemrightonline.com) (use
your university login details to access the site). Correct referencing
is an easy way to improve your marks and essential in achieving higher
grades on most assessments.

## 

## Technical submission problems

## 

It is strongly advised that you submit your work at least 24 hours
before the deadline to allow time to resolve any last minute problems
you might have. If you are having issues with IT or Turnitin you should
contact the IT Helpdesk on (+44) 2920 417000. You may require evidence
of the Helpdesk call if you are trying to demonstrate that a fault with
Moodle or Turnitin was the cause of a late submission.

## Extensions and mitigating circumstances

Short extensions on assessment deadlines can be requested in specific
circumstances. If you are encountering particular hardship which has
been affecting your studies, then you may be able to apply for
mitigating circumstances. This can give the teachers on your programme
more scope to adapt the assessment requirements to support your needs.
Extensions and mitigating circumstances policies and procedures are
regularly updated. You should refer to your degree programme or school
Moodle pages for information on extensions and mitigating circumstances.

## Unfair academic practice

Cardiff Met takes issues of unfair practice **extremely seriously.** The
University has procedures and penalties for dealing with unfair academic
practice. These are explained in full in the University\'s Unfair
Practice regulations and procedures under [Volume 1, Section
8](https://www.cardiffmet.ac.uk/registry/academichandbook/Pages/Ah1_08.aspx)
of the Academic Handbook. The Module Leader reserves the right to
interview students regarding any aspect of their work submitted for
assessment.

Types of Unfair Practice, include:

**Plagiarism,** which can be defined as using without acknowledgement
another person's words or ideas and submitting them for assessment as
though it were one's own work, for instance by copying, translating from
one language to another or unacknowledged paraphrasing. Further examples
include:

-   Use of any quotation(s) from the published or unpublished work of
    other persons, whether published in textbooks, articles, the Web, or
    in any other format, where quotations have not been clearly
    identified as such by being placed in quotation marks and
    acknowledged.

-   Use of another person's words or ideas that have been slightly
    changed or paraphrased to make it look different from the original.

-   Summarising another person's ideas, judgments, diagrams, figures, or
    computer programmes without reference to that person in the text and
    the source in a bibliography/reference list.

-   Use of assessment writing services, essay banks and/or any other
    similar agencies (NB. Students are commonly being blackmailed after
    using essay mills).

-   Use of unacknowledged material downloaded from the Internet.

-   Re-use of one's own material except as authorised by your degree
    programme.

**Collusion**, which can be defined as when work that that has been
undertaken with others is submitted and passed off as solely the work of
one person. Modules will clearly identify where joint preparation and
joint submission are permitted, in all other cases they are not.

**Fabrication of data**, making false claims to have carried out
experiments, observations, interviews or other forms of data collection
and analysis, or acting dishonestly in any other way.

## How is my work graded?

Assessment grading is subject to thorough quality control processes. You
can view a summary of these processes on the [Assessment Explained
Infographic](https://outlookuwicac.sharepoint.com/sites/QED/Shared%20Documents/Forms/Front%20Page.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FQED%2FShared%20Documents%2Fstudent%20guide%20%2D%20Is%20my%20mark%20fair%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FQED%2FShared%20Documents&p=true&originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly9vdXRsb29rdXdpY2FjLnNoYXJlcG9pbnQuY29tLzpiOi9zL1FFRC9FYzNrWVFRZUVIZEtyQ2JvX3RKbnIya0JvbUlpaUxJTm1QZWJVZ3ZUVWxqcTlRP3J0aW1lPXFLb08zblB3MkVn).

Grading of work at each level of Cardiff Met degree courses is
benchmarked against a set of general requirements set out in [Volume 1,
Section
4.3](https://www.cardiffmet.ac.uk/registry/academichandbook/Documents/AH1_04_03.pdf)
of our Academic Handbook. A simplified version of these Grade Band
Descriptors (GBDs) with short videos explaining some of the academic
terminology used can be accessed via the [Facilitation of
Learning](https://outlookuwicac.sharepoint.com/sites/QED/SitePages/Facilitation-of-Learning.aspx)
resource page.

We would strongly recommend looking at the [Study
Smart](https://learn.cardiffmet.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1416) area of
Moodle to find out more about assessments and key academic skills which
can have a significant impact on your grades. Always check your work
thoroughly before submission.
