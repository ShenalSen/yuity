Task/assessment brief:

TOUR MATE is a famous cab service in the city and the company management wants to create an application to manage their main processes.

Create an error free, effective application with user friendly interfaces (GUI/Console), appropriate messages, outputs and a menu-driven structure using the C++ programming language. Students can use appropriate data structures and text files to store information.

Main requirements:
• View available Vehicle Details
• Add/Update/Delete Vehicle details
• Manage Sales details

Other requirements:
• User login
• Logout
• Exit
• View Company Details

Notes:
- The system must be menu-driven, showing user choices and allowing users to select an option.
- Proper error handling techniques and easy navigation must be implemented to ensure user-friendliness.
- Use an appropriate data storage mechanism (files, arrays, etc.) and modularization techniques.
- The system must be carefully tested to ensure accuracy.

Students must submit:
- Softcopy of the error-free program.
- Documentation.
- Backup copies.

Tasks:

1. **Design flow charts** for the system including core functions (25 marks) (LO1, LO2)
   a. Explain the use of controlling structures (selection, repetition) during designing flow diagrams. Describe advantages of modularization. (10 marks)
   b. Use appropriate modularization to reduce design complexity. Design flow charts using valid flow chart symbols and logical instruction flows. (15 marks)

2. **Develop a functional C++ program** by following the above design. Use modularization and control structures to improve code efficiency. Use files or arrays for storage and backups. Focus on accuracy, user friendliness and competence. (50 marks) (LO3)

3. **Prepare a test document** including test plan, test cases, and test results. Conduct user acceptance testing and provide feedback with sample questionnaires. Follow a standard report structure. (25 marks) (LO4)

Word count (or equivalent): 3000
(Includes source code, text, tables, calculations, figures, subtitles, and citations. References and appendices excluded.)
